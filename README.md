### HW2-Regan Alt-545:
#### This dataset uses 2010-2018 USA Census population and estimated population data and applies the equal proportions method. The goal of the analysis was to predict the number of House of Representatives members for each state expected from the 2020 census results which were not released at the time of this analysis. Results were accurate based on 2020 electoral votes.

### HW5-Regan Alt-545:
#### This dataset is derived from Google Finance and the US Federal Reserve Bank website. We split the data into training and test sets to compute portfolio weights and created time-series plots based on the returns of the S&P500 and long-term treasury bond returns. Using the training set, we found the correlation and rolling-window correlation between the two asset returns to determine which visualized the relationship between the assets better. Then we computed the Sharpe ratio for each asset to see which is a better investment. After, we determined the optimal weight for each asset in our own portfolio, compared the three assets, and strategized which portfolio to pursue based on returns at the end of the period (2003 - 2014).
